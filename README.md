# DoDo - Server
This repo can be seen as the Server application of my [DoDo Android application](https://github.com/MapManagement/DoDo).
It's not absolutely necessary but surely improves your experience with it. I'm planning on a server program which
can be connected with clients to save and sync data (todos and notes on my case) on multiple devices. Therefore, this
repository will give you the opportunity to host the program on your own server. Further explanations and overviews are
already in the making.
